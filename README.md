# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

A Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors system activity and alerts the user when suspicious behavior is detected.

## 📌 Description

This project is a **host-based intrusion detection system** developed in **Python**.  
The application continuously monitors **system processes and activity levels**.

If the system detects an **abnormal increase in the number of running processes** or other suspicious behavior, it assumes a potential intrusion or malicious activity.

When such behavior is detected, the system:
- Triggers an **alert**
- Plays a **beep sound** to immediately notify the user

The goal of this project is to provide a **basic early-warning mechanism** for identifying unusual system behavior and increasing user awareness of possible security threats.
